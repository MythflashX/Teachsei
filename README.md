Teaching aids...I guess??? xD

I m teaching an elementary kid and i m too lazy to make actual teaching aids for him to practice....so i figured why not write programs for those 
repetitive tasks....and i went and wrote these...even tho my codes are really bad...took longer than making actual teaching aids....it work for the kid 
and that's really cool actually...the kid get to learn stuffs and i get to practice by writing those codes...so i m gonna keep making them and post here...
